# How to play

#### The basic premise of the game is to guess the correct blank spaces until you figure out the name of the film. You will be given 3 clues as you lose lives which, should help you to guess the title correctly. Once you win or lose you will be sent to a new page and if victorius your high score will be shown. If the film is too difficult to guess press refresh at the top right hand section of the screen

Now that you have pressed a button the blank spaces will appear each space is a letter in the film. As you guess the correct letters, the blank spaces will change in relation to their position in the films title.

If your guesses are wrong, the lives and hangman as referenced by the left arrow will update accordingly to show how many chances you have left.

The clues as referenced to the right will also update to help aid you to figuring out the correct answer. Three clues in total will be shown, the first a still from the film, the second the films tagline/slogan and finally a brief explanation of the film. The second two will interchange so make a mental note of the second one in advance of you losing more lives.
